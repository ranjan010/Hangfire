# Hangfire - Background Job Processing for .NET

## Description
Hangfire is a powerful framework for background job processing in .NET applications. It enables the creation, scheduling, and processing of background tasks such as sending emails, processing data, and performing other time-consuming operations asynchronously. Hangfire runs seamlessly within the .NET ecosystem, making it a great choice for developers who need reliable, easy-to-implement background job processing.

This project is a custom implementation or extension of the Hangfire library, which might include enhancements, specific use cases, or integration details tailored to your needs.

## Key Features
- **Background Job Processing**: Easily manage background tasks with minimal setup.
- **Dashboard**: Includes a built-in dashboard to monitor jobs in real-time.
- **Support for Delayed Jobs**: Schedule jobs to be executed at a future date and time.
- **Recurring Jobs**: Automate recurring tasks like sending reports or updates.
- **Reliable & Scalable**: Support for multiple storage backends (SQL, Redis, etc.) and scales well across different environments.

## Technologies Used
- **Hangfire**: Core background job processing library for .NET.
- **ASP.NET Core**: For web-based applications (if applicable).
- **SQL Server/Redis**: For job storage (specify which backend you're using).
- **C#**: Primary programming language.
- **Docker**: (Optional) If you are using Docker for containerization.
- **Other Libraries**: List any additional libraries you may have integrated, e.g., logging or custom job filters.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how to enqueue a simple background job:

```csharp
public class ExampleJob
{
    public void SendEmail(string recipientEmail)
    {
        // Logic to send an email
    }
}

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddHangfire(x => x.UseSqlServerStorage("your_connection_string"));
        services.AddHangfireServer();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseHangfireDashboard();
        app.UseHangfireServer();
        
        // Enqueue a background job
        BackgroundJob.Enqueue(() => new ExampleJob().SendEmail("user@example.com"));
    }
}
